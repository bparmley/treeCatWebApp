They are marginally hardy in our area (zone 6) but there are several beautiful specimens in Pleasant Grove so they are worth trying. They have average drought tolerance but do not suffer damage from many pests. They do tend to suffer winter dieback especially in colder areas. The flowers continue throughout the summer and attract hummingbirds.",
